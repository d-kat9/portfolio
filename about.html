    <h1>About üë©‚Äçüíª</h1> <br> <br>
    <p>I am a passionate front-end developer who is experienced in JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, and WordPress. I am looking for a long-term career with a groundbreaking company who values hard work and dedication. On a daily basis, I enjoy creating applications that are understandable, fast, accessible, and visually appealing to all of its users. I am very confident in my skills and enjoy solving intractable problems. 
        <br> <br>
        In February 2020, I moved from St. Petersburg, Russia to the United States. As a first-generation immigrant, I dealt with my fair share of adversity. With English being my second language, I found it difficult to deal with the social anxiety and culture shock that comes with moving here. However, I feel that this experience has allowed me to grow into a stronger and better version of myself and will allow me to excel in anything that I do.
        <br> <br>
        My first job upon moving to the United States was with Pyle Financial Services in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. At Pyle Financial Services, I started as an Intern and then got promoted to an Assistant Financial Advisor and worked with several tech platforms (eMoney, RightCapital) on a day-to-day basis. However, after working there for several months, I realized that working in the financial sphere was not for me. I simply did not have a passion for Finance. I wanted to find a career that got me excited and for that I had to think back to my childhood.
        <br> <br>
        Ever since I can remember, I have always been fascinated with computer programs and the World Wide Web. At a young age, I dabbled with Python and HTML. They just made sense to me and most important of all, I ENJOYED doing it and learning something new. I have a genuine passion for tech that can not be taught and I am so excited to see where this career field takes me!
